FULL TIME: Crystal Palace 0-1 Tottenham Hotspur

And that’s that! Christian Eriksen’s stylish snapshot is enough to secure victory! It wasn’t much of a match, but matters of style are very much secondary at this stage of the season. Tottenham move to within four points of leaders Chelsea, with five games remaining! The title race is alive and kicking! Who’s next, then? Ah look, it’s Arsenal at White Hart Lane on Sunday. Can you wait? No, us neither!
